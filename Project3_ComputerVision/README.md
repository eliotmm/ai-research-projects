## üéØ Context

In high-pressure physics experiments using diamond anvil cells (DAC), X-ray diffraction produces 2D images containing **diffraction spots (‚Äúblobs‚Äù)**.  
These blobs encode critical information about the **crystal structure, orientation, and phase transitions** of materials under extreme conditions (pressures > 100 GPa).

However, experimental images often suffer from:
- **Noise and artifacts** (mechanical masks, parasitic diffraction, detector issues),
- **Blob overlap** or partial masking,
- **Intensity loss** at the image periphery (Beer‚ÄìLambert law).

üëâ Automatic blob detection and reconstruction is thus essential for reliable material characterization.

## üß© Objectives

1. **Blob segmentation**: Identify blobs in noisy diffraction images.  
2. **Blob reconstruction**: Reconstruct partially masked blobs to recover shape, intensity, and position.  
3. **Validation**: Assess robustness of algorithms on both synthetic and real experimental data.

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Segmentation
- **Differential methods** (Laplacian of Gaussian, gradient-based)
- **Watershed segmentation (LPE)**:
  - Gradient computation
  - Local minima detection
  - Region growing until flooding frontiers meet

---

### 2. Reconstruction by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD / PCA)
- Build a **modal basis** from a dataset of complete blobs
- Represent each blob as a linear combination of dominant modes
- Solve a **least-squares problem** restricted to observed pixels
- Add **Ridge regularization** for stability under noise

Pipeline:

### 3. Experimental Validation
- Extract training blobs from real diffraction images  
- Reconstruct masked blobs using POD projection  
- Evaluate quality with **MSE, PSNR, SSIM**

## üìä Results

- **Synthetic blobs**: POD achieves near-perfect reconstruction for centered blobs (PSNR > 65 dB, SSIM ‚âà 1.0).  
- **Decentered blobs**: performance drops ‚Üí iterative recentering by center of mass proposed.  
- **Real data**:
  - POD reconstructs partially masked blobs with reasonable fidelity.
  - Adaptive masking (quantiles) improves boundary realism.
  - Regularization helps reduce overfitting to noise.
